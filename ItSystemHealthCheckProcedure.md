# A system health check procedure
# General Procedure for an IT System Health Check(ITSHC)
## The following steps outline a general procedure for conducting an effective IT system health check: 
1. Inventory and Documentation: Compile an inventory of all hardware and software components, their configurations, versions, and dependencies. This documentation serves as a baseline for the assessment.
2. Define Scope and Objectives: Clearly define what systems are included in the check and what the intended results are (e.g., performance improvement, security audit, or pre-upgrade verification).
3. Network Assessment: Evaluate network infrastructure components (switches, routers, firewalls) for configuration issues, performance bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities.
4. System Evaluation: Assess the performance and stability of servers and virtual machines by monitoring key metrics like CPU usage, memory utilization, and disk space. Look for high resource consumption or software conflicts.
5. Security Analysis: Review implemented security measures, ensure consistent application of security patches, and check configurations against best practices to safeguard against threats.
6. Data Protection Review: Evaluate data backup and recovery processes to ensure data integrity and business resilience.
7. Automated Monitoring: Implement or utilize automated tools to continuously monitor system metrics and thresholds, which helps in catching and fixing errors before they escalate.
8. Reporting and Recommendations: After the evaluation, generate a detailed report of all findings, including severity levels, potential impacts, and specific recommendations for improvement. This report guides the creation of an action plan.
